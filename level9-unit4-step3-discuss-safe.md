Health and safety at work

No place is completely safe, and that includes the workplace. Here are a few things you can do at work to stay safe and healthy.

Don't go to work sick. If a colleague is sick at work, avoid contact with them. Perhaps you can even ask them to go home.
In case of fire, know where the fire extinguishers are and how to use them. Also, know where the emergency exits are, and how to safely evacuate the building.
Make sure there are first-aid kits in the workplace. If someone is injured, they might need immediate care.
Use ergonomic equipment. This can help avoid injuries from typing or sitting too long.
If something at work makes you feel unsafe or unhealthy, report it to your manager.
