形容词的比较级

```
形容词比较级
当两个人或者事物进行比较的时候，我们会用上比较级，并且跟随者then对于单音节的比较级是加-er
Slow-slower
Tall-taller
The desktop computer is slower then the laptop computer.
对于两个或两个以上的形容词，用more or less + adj + then。 形容词不变
Expensive => more expersive then/less expensive then
The laptop computer is more expensive then the desktop.
The desktop computer is less expensive then the laptop.
如果已经知道您在说什么，那么句子中的then这个部分可以去掉
My old computer is slow . i need something faster. (then my old computer)
You can buy a desktop or laptop computer.
The laptop is more expensive.(then the desktop computer)


More expensive then - cheaper then 
Slower then - faste then 
Heavier then - lighter then 
Easier then - more diffcult then
Fancier then - planiner then 
Older then - newer then 

Computer A is $1,200. It's a laptop. It's fast and powerful. It's very reliable. It's also attractive and light.
Computer B is a desktop. It's cheaper than computer A. It's $699. It's also slower and less powerful. It is very reliable. It's also attractive but a lot heavier than computer A.

词尾为-ly的副词

```
带 '-ly'的副词

方式副词修饰动词的意义。它们通常由形容词后加-ly形成。例如，副词slowly 和quickly给我们关于动词decreasing的重要信息。

slow > slowly                                     
The price is decreasing slowly.                     	价格正缓慢下降。              
 	 	 
quick > quickly
The price is decreasing quickly.                  	
价格正迅速下降。                
 	 	 
如形容词以辅音 + y 结尾，改 y 为 i，再在末尾加 -ly。
 
busy > busily
The people in the office are working busily.        	
办公室里的人们正在忙碌工作。    
 	 	 
lazy > lazily
He's walking lazily down the street.                	他慢吞吞走在街上。  

不是所有的形容词都能通过加-ly变成副词的。这里有三个重要的例子：
 
good > well                                                  
He is doing well in school.                               	
他学习成绩很好。                        
 	 	 
fast > fast                                                                  
Gas prices are going up fast.                         	
油价上涨得很快。                   
 	 	 
hard > hard
She studies really hard.          	
她学习非常努力。
