##### 含有 as if 和 as though 的感官动词

```
带'as if' 和 'as though' 的感官动词

用感官动词 + as if 或 as though 来谈论你对某个情境的认知。
 

I feel as if I don't have enough time off.	我觉得好像自己的休假时间不够。

It looks as though I'll be compensated well.	似乎我会拿到很不错的工资。

It sounds as if you worked a lot of overtime.	听起来好像你经常加班。
 	 	 
在非正式的交谈中，你会听到 like，而非 as if 或 as though。这从技术角度而言不正确，但却很常见。
 

It seems like he's been off for a month.	他好像已经休假一个月了。

It looks like we'll have to work on the weekend.	看样子我们周末也得上班。
