##### 写关于一个电影

```
过去时被动语态

如果您要把焦点放在一个过去的动作，而不是完成该动作的人，用过去被动式。结构与现在被动式相同，除了助动词be 用过去式而不是现在式。
 

The special effects were created by 23 people.	特效由 23 个人制作。

The bank manager was shot by the bad guys.	银行经理被坏人开枪击中了。
 
如果完成了事情的人不重要或未知，by +人从句可以省略。
 

A: Guess what? The producer was fired.
B: Why?
A: The actors weren't paid.
B: Oh, no! Was a new producer hired?	猜猜怎么着？制片人被解雇了。
为什么？
演员没收到钱。
不是吧！新制片人请好了吗？
 
推断


文本中，事实和观点往往并不直接说明。在这种情况下，你必须做出推断。推断是一种猜测。
 

Gene Kelly did a great job in the movie 'Singin' in the Rain'! He's an excellent dancer.	Gene Kelly 在影片 'Singin' in the Rain' 中表现非常出色！他舞跳得很好。
 
作者并没有直接说 Gene Kelly 在影片 'Singin' in the Rain' 有跳舞，但因为两个关于电影和 Gene Kelly 的句子前后相邻，我们可以推断他在电影中跳过舞。
 	 
'The Class' is a great movie. It was made in France. 	'The Class' 是一部优秀的影片。影片在法国制作。
 	 
作者并没有直接说影片 'The Class' 中讲哪种语言，但由于影片在法国制作，我们可以推断它是法语影片。
 
 'A Simple Life' was made in Hong Kong. It was directed by Ann Hui. It's about an old woman, but there's never a dull moment. It's very different from big Hollywood action movies.

I don't like baseball, but 'Moneyball' was a very interesting movie. The story is a little dark. You learn some dreadful things about sports, but 'Moneyball' has a happy ending. 'Moneyball' is about the Oakland A's general manager, the famous Billy Beane. Beane wasn't given much money. He had to get creative. Billy Beane was played by Brad Pitt, and 'Moneyball' was directed by Bennett Miller. I think that actors always do a good job when they work with Bennett Miller.
