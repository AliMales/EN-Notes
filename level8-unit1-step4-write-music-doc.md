I just heard a song by Chanti Smith called 'Walking on Clouds.' What a beautiful song! First, Chanti sings quiet, low notes. Then the melody changes , and she sings the high notes a little louder. She has a great range and lightly hits the high notes. You can't really dance to 'Walking on Clouds' because there isn't much of a beat . But the song has a relaxing mood with romantic lyrics . It made me think about how my boyfriend Logan and I first met. Anyway, you should listen to it. I really enjoyed it.
