##### 解决员工问题

```
作问题
 
与生活中其他方面一样，有时工作中也会碰到一些问题。一位员工可能需要与老板就以下方面谈话：
 

being late = tardiness	迟到

being disorganized	缺乏条理的

being lazy	懒惰

being sloppy	粗心

being argumentative	好辩

being offensive	无礼

not being flexible	处事不灵活

not following instructions	不遵守指示

not working well with the team	和团队合作不愉快

not meeting deadlines 	没有如期完成
```

```
He's not working well with the team.
他和团队协作得并不好。

She spoke to me about my tardiness.
她跟我谈了谈我的迟到问题。

She was warned about not being flexible enough.
她因为处事不够灵活被警告了。

Not meeting deadlines is unacceptable.
不能按时完成工作是不能接受的。

He was fired for being offensive.
他因为无礼被解雇了。

Being argumentative at work is not a good thing.
工作中爱争论不是好事。

I have to stop being so disorganized.
我必须不能再缺乏条理了。

Sorry! I wasn't following instructions.
对不起！我没有遵照指示。
```

##### 'who' 引导的关系从句

```
用关系从句连接两个句子。关系从句使您的写作和讲话更流利，并帮助您避免重复。关系代词 who 用来指人。
 

We have a lot of engineers. The engineers work late.                  

We have a lot of engineers who work late.

在例子中，主句We have a lot of engineers 是一个完整的句子。关系从句who work late不是一个完整的句子，故不能独立成句。
```

```
I have a colleague. The colleague is very sloppy.
我有一个同事。这个同事做事非常马虎。

I have a colleague who is very sloppy.
我有一个做事非常马虎的同事。

I work with a guy. He never meets deadlines.
我和一个人共事。他从不按时完成工作。

I work with a guy who never meets deadlines.

I have a new boss. She isn't very flexible.
我有一个新老板。她处事不是非常灵活。

This is something that we have to deal with.

We have to figure out a solution for this.

One solution could be that I come early.
一种可能的解决办法就是我来早点。

不，我不这样想。

Another possibility would be for me to work late.
另一种可能就是我晚点走。

That would work.
那可行。

Let's see how it goes.
