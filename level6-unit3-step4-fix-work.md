##### 提出解决工作问题的办法

```
公司问题
 
您的个人或专业生活中可能会出现问题。公司也可能遇到问题。研究下面的常见公司问题。
 

Business is bad, and employee morale is low.	生意很差，而且员工士气低落。

Communication between management and staff is poor.	管理层和员工之间的沟通不畅。

There is a continuing problem of employee theft in the company.	公司里有员工盗窃的问题。

The company's costs are going up and up.	公司的开支一直在上涨。

Competition is fierce in our industry.	我们行业的竞争很激烈。

Because of terrible mismanagement, the company is in trouble.	因为管理不善，公司现在陷入困境。

The company's biggest problem is a lack of innovation.	公司最大的问题是缺乏创新。

We don't have the money to buy the latest technology.	我们没有购买最新技术的资金。
```

```

##### 'that' 引导的关系从句

```
用关系代词连接两个句子。用关系代词that 代替事物。
 

I work for a company. The company has lots of problems.

I work for a company that has lots of problems.

在该例子中，主句I work for a company 是一个完整句，关系从句that has lots of problems 不是完整句，故不能单独成句。

记住，使用关系从句可以让你的作文和讲话更流畅，避免重复。
```

```

The Clayton Harelson Company made beautiful motorcycles that were popular around the world. It cost a lot to make them in the US, so the motorcycles were expensive. Problems began when other companies, in other countries, started making similar motorcycles. Company management decided they had two choices. One solution was to move the factory to a less expensive country. Another possibility was to have fewer workers in the factory and spend a lot of money on the latest technology to make the motorcycles.
