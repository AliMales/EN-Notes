My office is a pretty casual place. There are approximately 25 employees. Most people work 40 hours a week, give or take.  We are all friends, and we spend time together outside the office. We go out to dinner or for drinks two times or so a month. We also have two managers. One is young and relaxed. The other is a little bit older and is stressed out sometimes. I take about three weeks' vacation each year. Last year I went to Hawaii with another employee. We had a lot of fun.

What's it like to work here?
The Sizzlr office is a pretty casual place. There are approximately 25 employees. Most people here work 40 hours a week. We're all friends, and we like to spend time together outside the office. We go out to dinner two times or so a month. There's also the CEO. He's young and relaxed. Then there's the CFO. He's a little bit older and is under lots of pressure, but he still finds time for fun. I get about three weeks' vacation per year. Last year I went to Hawaii with some other colleagues. It was amazing!

Hi, Jack.

I'm really looking forward to joining the team! I have some questions about the company culture at Big Company.

First of all, I'd like to know something about the office environment. Is it an open office? Do people sit in separate offices?

Can you also tell me something about the local area? What restaurants and cafes are around, and what lunch options do we have?

Finally, what's the work-life balance like? Are people overworked? Is it a relaxed company culture or very serious? I want to be prepared!

Thanks!

Nathan
