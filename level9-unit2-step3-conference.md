At the beginning of negotiations, their preliminary offer was $475 per general office laptop. That's full price ! Obviously, we couldn't accept that. Then, because we wanted to buy 175 machines, they offered us a bulk discount . I checked with my boss, and we finalized the deal at $425 per machine.

The best kind of negotiation ends in a win-win situation. That is, both sides feel that the final deal was good for them. There are specific negotiating strategies that can be used. First, separate the people from the negotiations. Don't let emotions and personalities get in the way of an agreement. Second, don't focus too much on preliminary offers. Try to understand what will be good for both sides. Third, work with the other side to find solutions that will lead to a win-win result. Finally, be honest and fair. Look at the facts on both sides. Try following these steps to increase your chances of a win-win result.
