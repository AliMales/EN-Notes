##### 量词

```
可以用装食物的容器来说明食物的数量。 在表示不可数名词（如 water 或 bread）的数量时，由于它们没有复数形式，因此 a bottle of 和 a package of 等量词特别有用。
 
用 a bottle of 或 a liter of 来说明某些液体的数量。
 

A: I'd like a T-bone steak and a bottle of sparkling mineral water.	我想要一份 T 骨牛排和一瓶发泡矿泉水。
 	 

B: Certainly. A T-bone, and would you like a liter of sparkling mineral water or just a small bottle?
```

##### 用 a package of 来说明某些固体的数量。

```
We didn't have dessert at the restaurant, so after dinner we bought a package of cookies.	我们在餐厅没有吃甜点，所以吃完饭后，我们买了一袋饼干。
 	 
用 a carton of 来说明某些液体和固体的数量。
 

You're still thirsty? I think you've had a carton of milk already.	你还渴吗？ 我觉得你已经喝了一盒牛奶了。
 	 

They brought out four huge cartons of ice cream and let us choose what we wanted.	他们拿出来四大盒冰淇淋，让我们选自己想要的。
```

##### 用 a loaf of 说明成块烘焙的面包的数量。

```
She served a loaf of bread hot from the oven.	她端上来一块刚刚出炉的热面包。

另一个有用的量词是 a dozen。 它指的是12个。

Culture Corner: Eating out

You sit at a comfortable table, and your server immediately introduces herself: 'Hello. I'm Julia. I'll be your server tonight.' Don't be surprised if the server gives you his or her first name. Most restaurants want you to feel comfortable, so servers are often informal but polite.

Your server will also ask you a lot of questions about your order – questions like 'How would you like that?' and 'What kind of dressing would you like on the salad?' After you start eating, your server may also come back to the table several times, asking, 'How is everything?' Don't worry; that's normal. Tell the server what you think, honestly and politely. The server wants to make sure you get exactly what you want and that you are pleased with your food.

After you've eaten, you may still have some food on your plate. That's fine. Your server might ask 'Would you like to take that home with you?' If you do want to take the food home to eat later, the server will put the food in a package 'to go.'

Finally, it's important to give your server a tip before you leave. Servers usually expect a tip that is at least 15 percent of the bill, but customers sometimes leave a 20 percent tip for excellent service.
