在餐馆结束用餐

给小费

在美国，用餐者应留总额的 15% 到 20% 给服务员，这称为 tip。如用信用卡支付，通常账单上会有小费一栏。如用现金支付，你应留下用餐费和多余的钱。
 

A: How big a tip should we leave?
B: The service was really good, so let's leave 20%.	我们该留多少小费？
服务很棒，那么我们给 20% 的小费。
 
 
食物打包

在美国，用餐者常常将吃剩的食物带回家。服务员可能问您是否要打包带回家，您也可以问服务员可不可以打包。

to go 可指你在餐馆吃剩下、想带回家的食物，也指你没坐下来直接带走的外卖食物。
 

Waiter: Would you like to take that home with you?
Customer: Yes, I would. Thanks!	您想把这带回家吗？
是的，我要带走。谢谢！
 	 	 

Customer: I'd like the rest of my steak to go.
Waiter: No problem. I'll bring it back in just a minute.	我想把我吃剩的牛排打包。
没问题。我一会就拿回来。

Restaurant review
Serene Grill

by Carey Smith

Serene Grill is a great choice for dinner. Their specialty is steak, but they serve many other excellent entrees like roasted chicken and grilled salmon. My favorite is the salmon. There is also a great selection of appetizers. The shrimp cocktail is very popular, and the restaurant is famous for its fresh oysters. The desserts are delicious and authentic. You can choose from apple pie with vanilla ice cream to chocolate cake with fresh strawberries. Prices are reasonable, and the servers are friendly. Outdoor seating is available in the summer, and parking is free before 9 p.m.
