The City's Dark Future

'City Dark,' Cable 12's new police drama, is set in Chicago in the year 2050. In the first episode, Detective Ella Washington is walking down the stairs to her apartment when she finds a man who has been murdered. This isn't unusual, as the city has become more violent and dangerous. But two hours later, a woman is found dead in the apartment building of Ella's colleague, Dallas. Dallas tells Ella that the man and the woman had been in a 12-year relationship and had just decided to separate.
The plot was certainly fascinating. And here's an example of the dialogue, which was often weird but realistic:
Ella: They were a couple? You mean, like, in a relationship?
Dallas: Married, in love, engaged or just romantic friends – I don't know. But they were definitely in a relationship.
```

If you don't see every episode , you won't understand the story.
The dialogue is very realistic. it reminds me of things that i say.
The show is set tries to solve a violent murder.
logan and Ava were always fighting, so they've separated.
Each episode of this police show begins with a murder.

过去将来时
谈论将发生担忧被另一件事情主治而未发生的事情时，用 我was going to + 动词 然后用but 引导的过去时态分句
Chris was going to kiss Hannah , but her phone rang.
They were going to separate but they fell in love again.

你可以用同样的方式使用 was about to + 动词

The show was about to end but they wrote three more episodes 
The police were about to catch the murderer,but he run 

以 -ed 和 -ing 结尾的形容词
 
有时形容词的结尾决定了其使用方式。在以下示例中，请注意以 -ing 结尾的形容词描述的是事物，如电视节目；而以 -ed 结尾的形容词描述的则是人的感受。
