I'm feeling optimistic about my future. We've just met with a financial planner. We're setting up a college fund for our children, and I'm trying to build my investments. By the time I turn 35, I'll have started my own energy business. Before my kids graduate from college, I'll have doubled my profits. Hopefully, my investments will have performed even better than the expected 6% per year. Then my wife and I can travel around the world, even though the price of flights will have increased by 200%. By 2050, we'll have retired and bought a vacation home on Yellow Sands Island. Everything should be okay financially, so my primary concern will be for our health and the health of our environment.
