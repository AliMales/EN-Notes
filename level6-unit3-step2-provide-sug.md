##### 为你的朋友提建议

```
情态动词 'ought to'和'had better'
 
你可以使用情态动词 ought to 和 had better 来给予个人建议。Had better 语气强于ought to，在提出强烈的建议时使用。
 

He's very overweight. He ought to lose some weight.	他很胖，应该减减肥。
 	 	 

Your health is very poor. You had better quit smoking.	你身体很不好，最好把烟戒了。
 	 	 

had better 的否定是 had better not。ought to 的否定是 ought not to，但很少使用。
 


You had better not start smoking. It's a terrible habit.	你最好不要开始吸烟。这个习惯很不好。
 	 	 

She has terrible insomnia. She ought not to drink coffee in the evening.	她严重失眠。她晚上不应该喝咖啡。

Just ask Mary
Dear Mary,

I really want to quit smoking, but I can't. Every time I talk on the phone or drink coffee or alcohol, I have to smoke. My boyfriend says I smell bad. My friends don't want to go out with me. What can I do? Please help me.

Dear Paula,

Quitting smoking is very, very difficult. It's an addiction. Some people can't do it alone. My advice is that you ought to see your doctor. Your doctor can give you medicine to help.  Also, when you talk on the phone or drink coffee or alcohol, you had better eat something. That will keep your mouth busy.

Good luck!

Mary
