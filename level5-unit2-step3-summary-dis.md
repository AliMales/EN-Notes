寻找关键词
 
阅读英语看起来似乎很难，但好消息是您不需要每个词都认识，只要认识重要的词就可以了。如果您想知道今年在哪里开会，哪些关键词有助于理解这个句子？
 
As I mentioned in Monday's meeting, we're going to Moscow for the conference this year!
 
您或许只需要 going、Moscow 和 conference 三个关键词。如果您知道自己要找什么信息，就用不着每个单词都看了。

Dear all,

As I mentioned in Monday's meeting, we're going to Moscow for the conference this year! We've decided that we're going to stay for five days at the Praga Hotel. This is the longest conference we've had, so that's pretty exciting!

It's a really nice venue, with excellent facilities, a really big conference room and a few smaller rooms for breakout sessions. As discussed in the meeting, there will be presentations from all departments about what they are working on at the moment, and one day for team building, too.

If you have any questions, just let me know!

Biggy
