##### 看菜单

```
没有两份菜单是一样的，但绝大多数被分为几个成分，诸如starters, main courses 和desserts。识别这些成分和知道在它们中要寻找什么会使得餐单更容易认读。
 
Starters, 或appetizers通常出现在菜单的开头。这部分也许包括诸如soups and salads的小部分。
 

A: Would you like a starter?
B: The cheese appetizer sounds really good. 
您要开胃菜吗？
奶酪开胃菜听起来真的不错。

下一环节通常是main courses, 或 entrees。 Entree是一个法语词。
 

A: Have you decided on your main course?
B: Does the chicken entree come with rice? 	
您决定好要点什么主菜了吗？
鸡肉主菜配有米饭吗？

主菜通常会是淀粉食物和蔬菜搭配在一起，如大米和胡萝卜。
也许会在菜单上看到：comes with 或served with。
 

The steak is served with mashed potatoes and peas. 	牛排搭配土豆泥和青豆。

The fish comes with rice and beans. 

如果您想要一份额外的食物，如薯条或蔬菜，来和您的主食一起吃或分享，那么您可以点一份 side dish.
 
Let's get some extra side dishes for everybody at the table.	我们给桌上的每个人再来点配菜吧。

Desserts通常放在菜单的末尾，许多Desserts是根据它们的原产国而得名的。听听以下Desserts的发音。
 

tiramisu	提拉米苏                          

chocolate mousse	巧克力慕斯

lemon sorbet  	柠檬果汁冰球
```

##### 可数名词和不可数名词的量词

```
记住，大多数名词都是可数的，比如 apple 和 steak。这些可数名词都有复数形式，词尾通常是 s。
 	 	 

 one apple, two apples
 	 	 
有些名词不能这样计数，比如 soup 和 milk。要加以计数，你必须添加像 a cup of 或 two liters of 这样的短语。
 	 	 

a cup of soup, two cups of soup
 
大多数量词要么与可数名词搭配使用，要么与不可数名词搭配使用。A lot of 是一个例外。你可以用它搭配可数和不可数名词，谈论某物非常大的数量。
 

The garden salad has a lot of tomatoes.	花园沙拉里有许多西红柿。

Is there a lot of bacon in the soup? 	汤里面熏猪肉多吗？
```

使用 how many 询问可数名词的数量。
