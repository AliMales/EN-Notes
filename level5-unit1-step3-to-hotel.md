省略形式
 
记住，在英语口语中，单词的每个音素并非始终发音。尤其是元音常常缩短或省略。这些形式在书面英语中并不使用，但听到时要能够辨认，这非常重要。
 
请听 have to 的省略形式。注意书面和口语中不同的书写形式。Have to 听起来像 'hafta'，Has to 听起来像 'hasta'，Had to 听起来像 'hadta'。

Hi, Martin!

I have to fly to Budapest on Thursday. After I arrive, I have to go to Vaci Utca and then find Parliament. I also want to eat at an interesting restaurant, but it doesn't have to be fancy. Then I have to check in to my hotel. And I'd like to go to a good museum. Do you have any recommendations?

Thanks.

Karl
