He cut himself in the kitchen.	他在厨房切伤了自己。

##### 坚持

```
有时人们伤到自己时，不希望他人大惊小怪。他们可能会说：

Don't worry. I'm fine.	别担心。我没事。

It's not that serious. I don't need to see a doctor.	没有那么严重。我不用看医生。

Honestly, I can take care of myself.	真的，我能照顾好自己。

尽管有这些安慰性的话语，但他人仍然可能坚持采取行动：

It's company policy that you go to the emergency room.	公司政策规定你应该去急诊室。

I really must insist that you see a doctor.	我真的认为你必须去看医生。

Don't be foolish. You have to take care of that.	不要犯傻。你必须去治疗。

最后，受伤的人可能会改变主意：

I suppose you're right.	我想你是对的。
