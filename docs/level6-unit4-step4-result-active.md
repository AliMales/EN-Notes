##### 总结社交活动

肯定反意疑问句

```
与否定反意疑问句相同，肯定反意疑问句用于确认某事真假或征求同意。
 
跟在否定句后的肯定的反意疑问句，绝大多数由do + 代词构成。注意，该动词常被缩写。

You don't remember his name, do you?	你不记得他的名字，是吗？

She didn't like the food, did she?	她不喜欢这种食物，是吗？

如果句中含有be动词，或诸如can 或 have的助动词，在反义疑问句中用该动词。

Tom isn't the CEO, is he?	Tom不是首席执行官，是吗？

They weren't at the event, were they?	他们不在活动现场，是吗？

We can't go next week, can we?	我们下周去不了，是吗？

Martha hasn't hired any new people, has she?	Martha 没有聘用新人，是吗？
```

```
You don't remember his name, do you?
你不记得他的名字了，是吗？

They weren't at the event, were they?
他们那时没去那场活动，是吗？

We can't go next week, can we?
我们下周去不了，是吗？

Martha hasn't hired any new people, has she?
Martha 还没招聘新人，是吗？
```

##### 表达犹豫的观点

用如guess, seem或think类的动词和maybe或probably 类的副词表达一种试探性意见。注意这些词强调表述的试探性的发音。
