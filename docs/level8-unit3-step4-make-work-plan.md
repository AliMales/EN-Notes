What you need in industry today

by Olly Adams

 

Different industries, from technology to education, require different skill sets. But if you're good at computing, presentations, communication and management, you'll be able to find work in many disciplines. For example, sales, operations and marketing departments are often very happy to give posts to people who show high levels of proficiency in the areas mentioned above.

Of course, if your long-term goal is to move up in your company, then you'll need to gain experience in the industry and build knowledge of the sector you're working in.
