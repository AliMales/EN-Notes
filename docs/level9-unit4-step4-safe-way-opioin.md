Dear Health Inspector,

I just read your report on our coffee shop. I think it's outrageous. You must only have spent maybe 30 minutes observing us, and then you compile a terrible report. A score of six? Really? I'll probably lose my job for this, you know.

You even claimed one of my employees, Karen, was using dirty cups. Untrue! She's a new employee. I am her mentor, I observe everything she does, and she does NOT use dirty cups. Furthermore, you stated that we do nothing to protect the customers from coffee that's too hot. We always ask our customers how hot they want their coffee. I really don't understand why you were so critical.

I demand a review. Our coffee shop is not a six. Our coffee shop is a 10! And we have hundreds of happy customers who would agree with that.

Dan Heath

Manager, Downtown Coffee

##### 现在完成时的被动语态

```
你可使用现在完成时的被动语态来谈论过去的动作，或者对现在有影响的事件。
 

New regulations have been announced by the government.	新规定已经被政府宣布。

The report has been compiled by a safety expert.	这份报告是由一名安全专家编写的。

A decision has been made by the local council.	一项决定已在当地议会做出。

记住，我们通常在动作的宾语比主动者（换言之，实施该动作的人或事物）更重要时使用被动语态。实际上，主动者有时可以完全省略。
 

New regulations have been announced.	新规定已经被宣布。

The report has been compiled.	报告已编写完成。

A decision has been made.	决定已经做出。

BILL: What's the matter, Patsy?
PATSY: Oh. Hey, Bill. Well, it's just the boss is always correcting me. No matter what I do. I'm sick and tired of it .
BILL: I know what you mean. The rules and regulations change so often, I'm totally confused.
PATSY: So, I worked late last night to finish a project. I think I left here around 8:15. Then, this morning, the boss tells me I broke an office rule by working after 8!

Australia has some of the strictest laws in the world regarding the use of cellphones while driving. It is prohibited to talk, text, play games, or take photos or videos. In general, you can't use your phone at all while driving. It's also illegal to use your phone when the car is stopped, unless you are in a parking space. What that means is, for example, you can't use your phone at a red light. Drivers who break these laws have to pay an expensive fine, and they also have to pay more for their car insurance.
