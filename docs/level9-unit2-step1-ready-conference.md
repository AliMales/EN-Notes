Re: planned computer upgrade

As you all know, we have a very limited budget right now. We would love to upgrade our computers to help all our employees become more productive . Unfortunately, we've been unable to negotiate a reasonable price with the vendor . It looks like we will have to stay with the standard model .

Thank you.

##### 带'what'的陈述句

```
what 一词常常用在问题开头。
 

What's so great about their computers?	他们的电脑有什么了不起的地方？

但是，你可在表述开头使用 what，用于强调。请看以下两条表述。含有 what 的表述语气更重。 
 

Their computers are powerful and dependable.	他们的电脑功能强大而且非常可靠。

What's so great about their computers is that they're powerful and dependable.	他们的电脑了不起的地方在于功能强大，而且非常可靠。
 	 	 
请注意，含有句子主语的 what 从句之后使用动词 be。
 

What we need to do is upgrade our software.	我们需要做的是升级软件。

What you should try is outsourcing the work to a vendor.	你应当尝试的是把这项工作外包给供应商。
