##### 商务习语和表达

```
表达可能同时具有字面和比喻意义。 当表达具有比喻意义时，称为“习语”。 再次观察这些商务习语及其定义。
 

walk out the door = leave	

24/7 = all the time (24 hours a day, seven days a week)

run behind schedule = go slower than planned	

miss the deadline = not meet the schedule

move forward  = continue	

back on track = on schedule again

wrap up = finish	

keep me informed = tell me what's happening

fast-track = achieve as quickly as possible	

work around the clock = work nonstop
```

```
Our product manager quit suddenly last week. She just walked out the door .
We'll have to work 24/7. We're already running two weeks behind schedule .
Communication is the key. Moving forward , how can we improve it?
They wrapped the project up in three months. It was incredible.
They're fast-tracking Tom for a manager's position. In only two years' time, he'll be a boss.
Our project is back on track . Everything's going much better now.
```

```
After a short delay, we are back on track.
在短时的延迟后，我们回到了正常轨道。
We'll work around the clock, if necessary.
如果必要，我们将昼夜不停地工作。
Moving forward, how can we work more efficiently?
加油，我们怎样能更有效率？
We wrapped up the project last week.
我们上周完成了该方案。
Unfortunately, we missed the deadline.
不幸的是，我们错过了最后的期限。

我今天有点落后于计划。
Can you fast-track my application?
您能快速查找我的申请吗？
Don't forget to keep me informed.
别忘了一定要通知我哦。
```

##### 时间连接词

```
时间连接词表示某事发生的时间。 用 until 表示某事继续到某个指定的时间。
 

The team will work around the clock until the project is finished.	 	整个团队将日以继夜地工作，直到项目结束。

用 as soon as 表示某个时间点后立即发生。
 

As soon as we wrap up the project, I will take some time off.	 	一等项目完成，我就马上休假。

She was fast-tracked for promotion as soon as she joined the company.	 	她一进入公司，立刻平步青云。
 
用 by the time 来强调某个动作或事件之前的时间段。 通常与过去完成时等时态搭配使用，比较两个时间点。
 
By the time we wrapped up, we had already missed the deadline.	 	等到完成，我们已经错过了最后期限。

My boss had gone by the time I finished writing the email.	 	等我写完这封电子邮件，老板已经离开。
```

```
My flight was delayed, and I didn't arrive until 9 in the evening. By the time I arrived at the hotel, I already had six messages waiting for me. As soon as I checked into my room, I called the client. We had already lost the deal by the time  I spoke with the client.
```

```
I have some very positive news …
我有一些非常好的消息……
… but also some bad news.
…同时也有一些坏消息。
First, the bad news.
首先是坏消息。
I wish that I had better news for you.
我希望能给你带来更好的消息。
I'm sorry to tell you this, but ...
很抱歉告诉你这些，但是…
```

##### 让人做好听取坏消息的准备

```
让他人做好接受坏消息的准备有几种常用方法。注意第二和第三个例子中 but 一词的使用，引出真实要传达的信息。

Unfortunately, there is a big problem.	不巧的是，有很大的问题。

I wish I had better news for you, but we have to cut staff.	我倒希望有好消息给你，但我们必须裁员。

I'm sorry to tell you this, but we didn't get the contract.	我很抱歉告诉你这件事，但是我们没拿到合同。

当新闻混杂时，即有一些好消息和一些坏消息，你可以使用下面的表达式。
 
I have some good news and some bad news.	我有一些好消息和一些坏消息。

然后，说话人可能会问听众想先听好消息还是坏消息。
 
Which would you like to hear first?	你想先听哪一种？
```

```
I have some good news and some bad news.
我有一些好消息和一些坏消息。
Which would you like to hear first?
你想先听哪一种？
I wish I had better news for you.
我希望我能有更好的消息带给你。
I'm really sorry to tell you this.
告诉你这个我真的很抱歉。
The bad news is that we have to cut staff.
坏消息是我们不得不裁人。
But the good news is your job is safe.
但好消息是你的工作是安全的。
```
