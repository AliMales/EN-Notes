过去完成时
 
使用过去完成时，表述两件过去事情发生的先后顺序。过去完成时由 had + 动词过去分词组成。Had 的缩写形式为 'd。注意以下例句中事情发生的顺序。
 
When he arrived at the interview, Mr. Jones had gone.	当他到达面试地点时，琼斯先生已经走了。

I'd sent my resume before I went to the interview.	我先发了简历，然后去参加面试。

She'd already applied for the job when she saw the terrible salary.	在看到糟糕的薪水时，她已经申请了那份工作。

句中含有 before 或 after 之类的时间连接词时，由于时间关系已经很清楚，因此不一定使用过去完成时。在这些情况下，你可以使用一般过去时。
 

He sent his resume before he went to the interview.	去面试前，他先寄送了自己的简历。

He flew to New York after he got the job.	他在找到工作后飞去了纽约。
 
```

```
