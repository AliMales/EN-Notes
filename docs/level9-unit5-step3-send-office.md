Hey, Jake.

Just wanted to drop you a quick note and let you know how my first day at the new job went.

Things didn't start off so well. Security at the front desk didn't have my name. It took me a long time to even get in the building. Once I was in the office, I was still feeling a bit lost. Then I met this really nice project manager, Ann Chambers, and she took the time to give me a tour of the office. I met a lot of people, and everyone was very friendly and welcoming.

Later in the day, I got my desk. It's in a nice section with a big, sunny window. I'll get my new computer tomorrow. And there's a big kitchen nearby with a coffee machine and a big refrigerator. A lot of people bring their lunches. That's great for me because I need to save money for an apartment.

Talk to you soon.

Carl
