'The Artist' is just like one of those old films. This romance was made in gorgeous black and white and takes place in the 1920s. And, just like the old films, there's no talking. There are only a few subtitles. But it's certainly not a remake of one of the old films from the 1920s. Remember how some of those old movies had really bad acting? Well, the acting in 'The Artist' is brilliant, and actor Berenice Bejo is incredible. This movie also has an original plot. 'The Artist' shows us what happens when a famous person has really bad luck. I won't tell you how it ends – see 'The Artist' for yourself.

##### 现在时被动语态

```
一种常见的句型是主语 +动词+宾语。

Ai Jones + directed + this fantastic film.	Ai Jones 执导了这部优秀的影片。
 
但是，如果宾语比主语重要，也可置于主语之前。这称为被动语态。

This fantastic film + is directed + by Ai Jones.	这部优秀的影片由 Ai Jones 执导。
 
注意以下现在时被动语态例子的结构：

The movie is directed by George Lucas.	电影由 George Lucas 导演。

The costumes are designed by Virginia Poole.
服装由 Virginia Poole 设计。

The main character is played by Bruce Willis.	主角由 Bruce Willis 扮演。
 
*by*短语指明了执行动作的人或物。如果该信息不重要，则可省略。例如，这里我们无需提及字幕是由译员完成：

The subtitles are translated into five languages.	字幕被翻译成五种语言。
```

```
