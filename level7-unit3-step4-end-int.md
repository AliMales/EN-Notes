Ending an interview

How you end an interview leaves an important impression on your interviewer. Here are some tips for how to leave a strong, positive impression.

Ask your own questions. This shows that you are interested, prepared and curious. What you ask, of course, will depend on the position and the interview. For example, you can ask about the office environment, team members, the compensation or salary range, the benefits package and even how decisions are made in the company.

Summarize why you're a good fit. Briefly restate why you are suitable for the position and why you would like to work there. When you summarize your strengths and show your enthusiasm for the position, you show confidence and leave a good impression.

Ask about next steps in the hiring process. For example, you can ask when they expect to make a decision. Ask if they need any additional information from you, such as personal references.
