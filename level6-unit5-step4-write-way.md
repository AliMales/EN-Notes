Hi, Katie.

对比正式用语与非正式用语
一般而言，非正式的句子更短，代词 I 的使用更频繁，包含更多个人看法。正式的句子通常更长，感情色彩更淡。以下举几个例子。非正式用语的句子每次先出现。
陈述您的目的
 
I think we should try to spend less money.	我认为我们应该努力少花钱。
The purpose of this proposal is to outline a plan to cut expenses.	本提案的目的旨在概述一个削减开支的计划。
 	 
总结问题
 
I think we should save more because things are getting more expensive, and sales are poor.	我认为我们应该更加节省，因为物价越来越贵，销售额非常不理想。
Because of increasing expenses and decreasing sales, the company has identified the need to make savings.	由于不断上升的开支和日益下滑的销售额，公司明确了开源节流的需要。
 
 
描述已采取的措施
I've looked at a few options.	我看过一些方案。
We have reviewed a list of options to find the best solution.	我们审查了许多方案，以求找到最佳解决办法。
 	 
提出一种解决方案
I think we should have a hiring freeze. It'll help cut expenses.	我认为我们应该暂停招聘，这有助于削减开支。
We are proposing a hiring freeze as the best way to cut expenses.	我们提议最好的办法是暂停招聘，以削减开支。
 	 
反对一种解决方案

We are rejecting layoffs as a solution, due to the negative effects it will have on staff.	我们拒绝裁员作为解决方案，因为它会给员工带来负面影响。

陈述优点和缺点
作为商业提案的一部分，您常常会加入对所提议解决方案的advantages and disadvantages 或 pros and cons 的分析。
 
One advantage is lower costs.	一个优点是降低成本。
Another pro is that revenues will increase.	另一个好处是收入会增加。
One con, however, is that we'll need to use staff more efficiently.	但是，不利之处在于我们需要更有效地使用员工。
A further disadvantage is that projects will not be finished so quickly.	还有一个缺点是项目不会很快完成。

使用类似 big 和 obvious 在内的形容词强调优缺点的重要性。
 	 
Another big advantage of a hiring freeze is that we can keep morale high.	暂停招聘的一大优点在于我们可以保持高涨的士气。
An obvious advantage is that we don't need to have any layoffs.	一个明显的优点是我们无需裁员。

Hi, Katie.

I've added a paragraph about the pros and cons. Could you please take a look?

Advantages and disadvantages

One advantage is lower recruitment costs. Another big advantage of a hiring freeze is that we can keep morale high. However, a con of a hiring freeze is that staff will need to perform a wider variety of tasks than they are used to.


Thanks!
