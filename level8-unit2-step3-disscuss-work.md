```
Everyone has stress in their lives. Stress is the way our body reacts to what is happening in and around us. Eustress, or good stress, can help people work to their potential and feel good about themselves. Think about a time when your boss told you what a good job you were doing, or you were excited playing a game. That is eustress. Sometimes it is called positive stress.

On the other hand, distress, or bad stress, is not a good thing. When stress becomes too much for a person to deal with, it can cause problems. The problems can be physical or mental. Stress can result in problems like insomnia, headaches, depression and anxiety. Obviously, we want as much eustress, and as little distress, in our lives as possible.
