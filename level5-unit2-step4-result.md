##### 总结决定

```
寻找关键词
 
阅读英语看起来似乎很难，但好消息是您不需要每个词都认识，只要认识重要的词就可以了。如果您想知道今年在哪里开会，哪些关键词有助于理解这个句子？
 
As I mentioned in Monday's meeting, we're going to Moscow for the conference this year!
 
您或许只需要 going、Moscow 和 conference 三个关键词。如果您知道自己要找什么信息，就用不着每个单词都看了。 
```

##### 提及说过的事情

```
在会上做出决定后，使用类似短语回顾您说过的事情。这些短语在商务写作中尤为有用。

As I mentioned in Monday's meeting, we're going to Moscow for the conference this year!
如我在周一会上所提到的，我们今年打算去莫斯科开会！

As discussed in the meeting, there will be presentations from all departments.
如会上所讨论的，所有部门都会做演示。
```

##### 宣布决定

```
使用 decide、choose 和 agree 等动词宣布已经做出的重要决定。
 
We've decided to book three rooms.
我们决定预订三个房间。
 
We've chosen to have presentations on the first day.
我们决定第一天做演示。
 
We agreed to have the conference on the 5th.
我们决定把会议安排在五号。
 
如您看到的，所有这些动词都可接 to 后再接动词。
 
```

Dear managers,

As mentioned in the Friday morning managers' meeting, we've decided to have this year's conference in Tijuana, Mexico, as it was the cheapest option and the nearest to the office. We're really excited, and we're sure it's going to be even better than last year's!

We've decided to have the conference at The Estrella, as it's the best hotel in the city and it's got excellent facilities. As discussed, we're going to use two main meeting rooms for the presentations.

This year's conference will last three days in total. We've chosen to have three main presentations this year – from marketing, finance and advertising. We've also decided to have team building on the last day, so everyone can enjoy themselves and get to know one another.

If you have any questions, just let me know.

Ziggy
