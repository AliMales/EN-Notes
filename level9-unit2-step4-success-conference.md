Hi, Sam.

Just wanted to take a moment and review the results of our negotiations. This is what I have: The vendor has confirmed that they can deliver 250 laptops at $850 per unit. That's down from the full price of $925. Delivery would be over the next three months. The total purchase price is $212,500.

The next step is for them to send us the contract. You will need to sign that. Oh, one question: The standard service plan is for two years. Are we interested in paying an extra $30 per unit to make that a three-year service plan? Let me know before they write up the contract.

Thanks,

Carol

OK, so we're finally all in agreement about the quantity and the bulk discount. I want to thank the vendor for increasing the discount. That seemed to break the deadlock . So, next steps: The vendor will send us the contract to review next week. Then delivery of the units will begin in about two weeks. Honestly, it's been a pleasure working with all of you. I look forward to building a strong relationship between our companies.
